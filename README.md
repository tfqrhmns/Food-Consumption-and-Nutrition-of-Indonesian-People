# Food-Consumption-and-Nutrition-of-Indonesian-People
This is personal project for portfolio Data Analysis
This project aims to analyze the food commodity consumption patterns of Indonesian people based on nutrient categories (Carbohydrate, Protein, Fat). The dataset is derived from government open data and visualized with Tableau and Python.

#Project Objective
- Identify the highest contributing commodities for each nutrient per year
- Analyze nutrient consumption trends from 2018-2024
- Manually categorize commodities by nutrient
- Provide Tableau ready dataset
# Tools
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Tableau Public
- Excel (for preprocessing)

# Folder Structure
- `data/` → contains raw files and cleaned files
- `notebooks/` → exploratory analysis notebooks
- `output/` → processed data ready for visualization (for Tableau)

# Main Result
- Top nutrient commodities (2018-2024)
- Average national consumption per nutrient
- Ready-to-use dataset for interactive Tableau dashboard

# Dataset
- `food consumption_cleanest.csv`: result of cleaning and classification of nutrients

# Insights
- Carbohydrate consumption is far more dominant than protein and fat
- Rice remains the main source of national carbohydrates
- Oil and eggs are the highest contributors to fat & protein
